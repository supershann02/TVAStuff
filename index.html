                    <p>Life for the Loki stans has been crazy since December 10th, 2020. <br>
                         Well, it's been crazy since Loki made his introduction into the <br>
                         Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2011. Regardless, the exclusive clip <br>
                         featuring Loki as a prisoner of the Time Variance Authority and, <br>
                         what arguablly broke the Internet most of all, him being DB Cooper. <br>
                         The series obviously involves time, and its importance was <br>
                         emphasized by the creation of a tumblr for the TVA. Yes, Marvel <br>
                         created a social media page for a fictional organization. Further <br>
                         excitement was added by the cyptric posts, most of which were not <br>
                         in but rather written in code. Luckily the Loki stans, including me, <br>
                         and are passionate and have skills in coding. Several posts have <br>
                         been correctly decoded.</p>
                    <p>This websites shows every posts and demonstrates the ways they <br>
                    have been decoded with their possible interpretations.</p>
