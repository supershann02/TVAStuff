                    <p>Life for the Loki stans has been crazy since December 10th, 2020. 
                         Well, it's been crazy since Loki made his introduction into the 
                         Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2011. Regardless, the exclusive clip 
                         featuring Loki as a prisoner of the Time Variance Authority and, 
                         what arguablly broke the Internet most of all, him being DB Cooper.
                         The series obviously involves time, and its importance was 
                         emphasized by the creation of a tumblr for the TVA. Yes, Marvel 
                         created a social media page for a fictional organization. Further 
                         excitement was added by the cyptric posts, most of which were not 
                         in but rather written in code. Luckily the Loki stans, including me, 
                         and are passionate and have skills in coding. Several posts have 
                         been correctly decoded.</p>
                    <p>This websites shows every posts and demonstrates the ways they 
                    have been decoded with their possible interpretations and also
                    serves as coding practice for me.</p>

                    <p>The headquarters of TVA information is located on their tumblr page,
                        a website where Tom Hiddleston's Loki is treated as a god. The 
                        original posts were strings of hex code put together with the 
                        occasional Base64, Then, as if wanting to make the Loki stans
                        suffer more, the account began to post memos, where the release
                        date was manipulated. Click on the image to see the Time Variance
                        Authority tumblr account. The button below is a link to every 
                        post decoded or interpreted.
